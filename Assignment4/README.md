## Assignment 4 

The whole assignment is written and tested with Sublime, Linux Python command line. 


In the linux command console, you can run:

### python Assignment4.py



The assignment is mostly implemented as instructed from class. The only thing that is different:

    Due to version 2.7 python is installed on my machine, I made an if not existed conditional check to verify whether the destination of downloaded pictures is already existed, instead of passing the parameters into the function os.makdir(path, ifexisted). 

Lastly, a folder "Assignment4_Downloaded_Pictures" will be created and storing all the pictures as jpg  file type from the requiring webpage.
