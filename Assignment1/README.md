## Assignment1 
The whole assignment was written and tested with Sublime, Linux Python3 command line 

Goal:

We are going to review all of the basic python concepts as well as learn some of the python specific language features.

Please create all of the following:

1. Write a function that will loop through from all the numbers from 0 until a user-supplied input n. It will print out all the numbers that are even.

2. Copy and modify the previous function (#1), and have it return a list of the numbers that are even, instead of printing them out.

3. Write a function that will take a user-supplied input n. It will need to use a list-comprehension to return a list of numbers from 0 through n. This function should only have one line of code.

4. Copy and modify the previous function (#3) to use a lambda function instead and call it to test it.

5. Create a function takes a user-supplied String input, sliceMe. Use slicing to return a list that contains every other letter in the word supplied.


In this assignment, I implemented 5 functions including one Lambda function as instructed. For every question I interpreted the word until as an inclusive. For question 2-5, I printed out all the returning lists for the convenience of checking if the results are correct. I also implemented extra conditional statements for question 1-2 to ensure the inputs are in correct types to prevent for having errors. I did not do extra input checking for question 3 due to the simplicity of one line code, similarily to Lambda function.
